# Software-Engineering-Blog
### My target: Starting by focusing on backend development, and becoming a solution architect in 5 years.
I build this repo to explain technologies and tools that I learn in my SW Engineering journey, as #3 in Andy Sterkowitz's learning fundamentals:  
  #1: Active vs Passive Learning Ratio (2h reading; 1h coding)  
  #2: Use "Spacing" (DON'T CRAM)  
  #3: Teaching Concepts (write about what you learned, explain how it works)  
  #4: Keep Track of Questions (you have when learning)  
  #5: Rest and Recover
